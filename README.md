# FinalProject
### Overview:
House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
This repository holds an attempt to apply 3 different regression techniques: XGB, Random Forest, and AdaRegressor using the data from "House Prices - Advanced Regression Technique".

### Approach:
We use boxplots and anova to pick categorical features, and then we use correlation matrix to pick numerical features. Then, we compare the 3 different models and see which one performs best. XGB performs with the RMSE between predicted log prices: 0.1505.

### DATA:
- 1460 Training samples with 79 explanatory variables.
- Size of the whole data folder: 957.39 kB.

### Preprocessing / Clean up:
- Using ANOVA, boxplots, correlation matrix, and pandas to choose and clean up features.
- We only use 38 features with the same amount of training data.
- 75% of the data is training set, 25% of the data is testing test.
