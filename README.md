# FinalProject
### Overview:
House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
This repository holds an attempt to apply 3 different regression techniques: XGB, Random Forest, and AdaRegressor using the data from "House Prices - Advanced Regression Technique".

### Approach:
We use boxplots and anova to pick categorical features, and then we use correlation matrix to pick numerical features. Then, we compare the 3 different models and see which one performs best. XGB performs with the RMSE between predicted log prices: 0.1505.
